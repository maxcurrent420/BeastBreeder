# BeastBreeder Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the future plans for the BeastBreeder game. It provides an overview of the current state of the project, as well as the features we plan to implement in the future.

## Current State

BeastBreeder is a monster breeding game centered around breeding insectoids. The game currently features a breeding system for creating new monsters with unique traits, a basic battling system for engaging in battles with other monsters, a store UI and logic for buying items and monsters, an inventory screen for managing collected items, procedural generation for generating quests, and saving and loading game data.

Progress has been made on the base HTML page, minimal styling, instantiating core game objects, starting logic, monster data and methods, and the home page and monster list.

## Planned Features

### Hosting on IPFS

We plan to host the game on IPFS to ensure it is decentralized and resistant to censorship. This feature is expected to be implemented by Q2 2023.

### Using MATIC to Buy In-Game Items

To provide a seamless experience for our users, we plan to integrate MATIC as a payment method for buying in-game items. This feature is expected to be implemented by Q3 2023.

### Minting AI-Generated Monster Images as NFTs

We plan to allow gamers to mint AI-generated images of monsters as NFTs. This will provide a unique and engaging experience for our users, as each monster will be unique. This feature is expected to be implemented by Q4 2023.

## Conclusion

We are excited about the future of BeastBreeder and look forward to seeing it grow. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community. Together, we can make BeastBreeder the best it can be.
